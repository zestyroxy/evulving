I love books. I inhale books on a daily basis. If books were drugs, I would be hooked up to a book intravenously…you get it.

Last year, I looked at all the books I read over recent years—yes, I keep lists—and most of the authors were men. Even the children’s books I borrowed at the library to improve my German were written by men or featured male protagonists. It was hard to find any story of a hero that wasn’t a white boy (unless it had to do with ponies).

That’s why I dedicated 2019 to women! 

In January, one of my friends and I embarked on the Reading Women Challenge: read 24 books. The catch? There are 24 different categories and the author must be a woman. It was a great way to get me to explore new topics and authors. So far, I’ve read 18/24. During my search, I’ve discovered various female authors and have read them too (or added them to my to-read list).

What I love about this list is that each author is different from me. I’ve learned something valuable from each and every one of them. 

I realize that this list comprises many white authors (a problem in our current society). But I’m actively searching for a more diverse set of books. Three of my upcoming reads are Grand Union by Zadie Smith, Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo and An Ocean of Minutes by Thea Lim. I even found this bookshop gem, [InterKontinental](https://www.interkontinental.org/){:target="_blank"}, in Berlin. It’s the first bookstore specializing in African literature in Germany.

Want more? Ask me. I have many more recommendations up my sleeve. Let’s trade book recommendations. #EvulvingBooks
