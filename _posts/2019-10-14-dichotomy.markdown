"I have been told that I can’t do what I want to do because I am a woman, and I have been told that I have only been allowed to do what I have done because I am a woman."  
-  Hope Jahren, *[Lab Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733983-lab-girl){:target="_blank"}*

This passage from Hope’s book made me laugh. And then, it made me sad. because Hope’s a scientist and even though she’s talking about her personal experience, her words ring true. I’ve heard the same song myself. No matter what I undertook, someone has told me some version of that quote. Can’t we just accept that women can do what they want because they have the drive to do it?

Here’s a small homework assignment:

Think of a few instances where you were doing something and someone told you “you can’t do that” or “you only got this far” because you’re a woman, even if you were nailing it. 
 
I leave you with some lyrics from *[The Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RauEVgRgj1IuWdJ9fDs70){:target="_blank"}* off Taylor Swift’s latest album for inspiration:

*I'm so sick of running  
As fast as I can  
Wondering if I'd get there quicker  
If I was a man*

*And I'm so sick of them  
Coming at me again  
'Cause if I was a man  
Then I'd be the man*

*I'd be the man  
I'd be the man*
