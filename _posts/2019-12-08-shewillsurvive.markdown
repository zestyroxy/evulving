Why is it the responsibility of the victim to protect themselves from rapists and to carry the shame afterwards. Rape culture isn't normal and it needs to stop.

I wrote a piece on the subject for [she will survive](https://shewillsurvive.com/){:target="_blank"} called [Rape: A Matter of Global Security](https://shewillsurvive.com/2019/12/06/rape-a-matter-of-global-security/){:target="_blank"}

Thank you to the Jitna, founder of shewillsurvive.com, for asking me to write the piece and for all the important work she does to help women survive.

Happy reading,
Roxanne
