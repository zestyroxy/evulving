Why is it the responsibility of the victim to protect themselves from rapists and to carry the shame afterwards? Rape shouldn't be part of our everyday life.

I wrote a piece on the subject of rape culture for [she will survive](https://shewillsurvive.com/){:target="_blank"} called [Rape: A Matter of Global Security](https://shewillsurvive.com/2019/12/06/rape-a-matter-of-global-security/){:target="_blank"}. I hope it makes you think. 

Thank you to the Jitna, founder of shewillsurvive.com, for asking me to write the article and for all the important work she does to help women survive. ðŸ’™

Happy reading,<br/>
Roxanne
