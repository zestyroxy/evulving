Cereals are innocent, right? Wrong. It dawned on me at breakfast the other day: there are no female cereal mascots, except for that one unicorn I saw on *Fruit Loops* this year.

Here are the *Fruit Loops* offerings in Australia. Why does female mean unicorn or mermaid? Have you ever seen a female cereal mascot? The only one I could find is Loopy, the mascot for Honey Pops Loops. It’s competitor *Honey Nut Cheerios* features a male character called BuzzBee, whom I know from my childhood.

*Jezebel* tackled this topic in an [article in 2013](https://jezebel.com/ever-notice-that-there-aren-t-any-female-breakfast-cere-5993962){:target="_blank"} and another blog *The Sneeze* tackled this [in 2008](http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000754.php){:target="_blank"}. If this topic was brought up over 10 years ago, why has nothing changed?

I did some research and found out that there used to be a few [female mascots](https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/forgotten-cereal-mascots){:target="_blank"} in the 1970s. Did you know that Tony the Tiger has a wife? And the Corn Pops mascot used to be a porcupine named Poppy. Why did they get rid of her?

I want to see a sporty tigress called Tonya and have her body slam Tony while saying she’s strong because of the “well-balanced” breakfast she’s eating. I want to see a non-binary mascot flying circles around Toucan Sam and his nephews, who are a little too reminiscent of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews.

Cereals aren’t the only culprit here. This topic was originally on my mind because of Clementine Ford’s book *Boys will be boys*. She pointed out that most character movies feature male heroes.

* Monsters Inc.
* Toy Story
* WALL·E (EVE is there, but she’s secondary)
* Transformers 
* Cars (Sally is secondary to Lightning McQueen and Doc Hudson)
* Up
* Coco
* Finding Nemo

Here are a few great exceptions:
* Inside Out
* Brave
* The Incredibles
* Moana
* Wreck-it Ralph (although the film is named after the man, not Vanellope)
* Frozen (although Sven, Christoph and Olaf are males)

It’s slowly changing, but still male-dominated and girls are usually “pretty” or “quirky” side-kicks. I want to be positive about the changes. Let’s support and demand more female heroes in our everyday lives!
