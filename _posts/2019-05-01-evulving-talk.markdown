This post will be a little different than usual, because I've been doing a different kind of writing. You see, I was invited to do a talk in front of a live audience. I spent the last month writing a 10-minute speech about body positivity and empowerment. I wanted it to be fun, so I gave the talk in stand-up format. It was inspired by a few of my favourite comedians (including Hannah Gadsby). It was my first time doing stand-upâ€”I love giving myself a challenge. 

I rehearsed the talk and the jokes multiple times a day for a week, rewriting jokes and adding new ones as I went. I wanted to get this right. In the end, the show went great and, most importantly, the audience laughed. Unfortunately, the live event (and the laughs) were not recorded, so I performed my set in my living room for you.
