	<h2>Evulving</h2>
	<p>In November 2018, I started writing a book as part of the yearly NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month); the goal is to write 50,000 words in 30 days. I was writing a semi-autobiographical fiction novel.</p>
	<p>In the mornings, before writing, I would read the book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21251323-everyday-sexism"><i>Everyday Sexism</i></a> by Laura Bates. The book was created thanks to the awesome responses her <i><a target="_blank" href="https://everydaysexism.com/">Everday Day Sexism Project</a></i> received. The book really touched me. I thought to myself "I've lived through 90% of this everyday sexist bullshirt!" (Yes, bullshirt is from Kristen Bell's character in <i>The Good Place</i>. Good catch, I like you already.)</p>
    <p>I stopped everything I was doing and started writing an autobiography. Every chapter features specific moments I've lived through where sexism and the fact that I own a vulva affected the situation. As it turns out, I have A LOT to say. Twenty days into writing the book, I realized this would actually be a great blog. So here we are.</p>

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>My name is Roxanne and I am in my early 30s. I am a Canadian living in Germany.</p>

    <h2>What's with the name?</h2>
    <p>Evolving + Vulva = Evulving</p>

    <h2>What can I expect?</h2>
    <p>A new post will be published every Monday and Thursday of every week until I am out of things to say.</p>

    <h2>What will the posts be about?</h2>
    <p>The posts will be about my life. I thought it could help to gather all the moments that seem insignificant, but ultimately oppress us on a daily basis. There are so many inequalities girls and women face throughout their lives; it needs to stop. Maybe if I share my entire experience, others will see it runs very deep.</p>
