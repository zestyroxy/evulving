	<h2>Evulving</h2>
	<p>In November 2018, I started writing a book as part of the yearly NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). The goal is to write 50,000 words in 30 days.</p>
	<p>In the mornings, before writing, I would read the book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21251323-everyday-sexism"><i>Everyday Sexism</i></a> by Laura Bates, created thanks to the awesome response her <a target="_blank" href="https://everydaysexism.com/">Everday Day Sexism Project</a> It really reached me and I thought to myself "I've lived through 90% of this bullshirt!" (Yes, bullshirt is from Kristen Bell's character in The Good Place. Good catch, I like you already.)</p>
    <p>I stopped everything I was doing and started writing an autobiography about all the moments I've lived through were sexism and my sex affected the situation. As it turns out, I have A LOT to say. Twenty days into writing my book, I realized this would actually be a great blog. So here we are.</p>

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>My name is Roxanne and I am 31 years old. I am from Canada, now living in Germany.</p>

    <h2>What can I expect?</h2>
    <p>A blog post will be posted every Monday and Thursday of every week until I am out of things to say.</p>

    <h2>What will the posts be about?</h2>
    <p>The posts will be about my life. I thought it could help to gather all the moments that seem insignificant, but ultimately oppress us on a daily basis. There are so inequalities girls and women face throughout their lives; it needs to stop. Maybe if I share my entire experience, others will see how it runs deep.</p>
