	<h2>Normal You Are Project</h2>
	<p>I started the normal project in April 2018 after realizing that many people, like myself, are struggling with accepting their true selves when facing the hurricane of external feedback that is the world.</p>
	<p>In early 2018, I was looking for books and research on the topic of "normal". I asked myself questions like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What does "normal" mean?</li> 
		<li>When did it all start?</li>
		<li>Who cares about being seen as "normal"?</li>
		<li>Why do we try so hard to fit into the norm?</li>
		<li>How can we change it?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have found a few papers, talks, and articles about the topic, but most of them were specific and didn't tackle the subject broadly. I want to change that. That's why I've started researching it myself and I will make my findings available to you on this website!</p>
